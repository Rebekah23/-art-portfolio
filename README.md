**User Stories**

1. As an art enthusiast, I want to easily navigate through a well-organized gallery, so that I can quickly find and view different pieces of artwork.
2. As an artist, I want to be able to upload and categorize my artwork easily, so that I can keep my portfolio up-to-date without any hassle.
3. As a visitor, I want to view high-resolution images of artwork with zoom functionality, so that I can appreciate the details and quality of each piece.
4. As an interested buyer or client, I want to see information about each piece of artwork including pricing and availability, so that I can make informed decisions about purchases or commissions.

**Risks**
